# Memory from Space

Single Player Memory game written in TypeScript & React.

My first TypeScript project.

Pictures fetched from NASA's Astronomy Picter Of The Day API.

Animations with [Framer Motion](`https://www.framer.com/motion/`).

### API Key

1. Get a key for NASA's API: [https://api.nasa.gov/](`https://api.nasa.gov/`)

2. create a `.env.local` file for the key: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=<your_key>`
